Towards a true neural stance on
consciousness

Opinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.11
Consciousness is traditionally defined in mental or
psychological terms. In trying to find its neural basis,
introspective or behavioral observations are considered
the gold standard, to which neural measures should be
fitted. I argue that this poses serious problems for under-
standing the mind–brain relationship. To solve these
problems, neural and behavioral measures should be
put on an equal footing. I illustrate this by an example
from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and
behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent
scientific definition of visual consciousness. However,
to accept this definition, we need to let go of our intuitive
or psychological notions of conscious experience and let
the neuroscience arguments have their way. Only by
moving our notion of mind towards that of brain can
progress be made.

Introduction
Consciousness is amultifaceted and complex phenomenon,
encompassing functions such as language, attention and
control. Its most enigmatic aspect, however, is that of
conscious experience [1]. Why do some processes in the
brain evoke conscious experiences, but others do not? The
question is still far beyond our reach, but neuroscience is
expected to provide an answer by finding the neural cor-
relate of consciousness (NCC) [2]. Experiments to find the
NCC invariably involve some manipulation of conscious-
ness, induced experimentally [3] or accidentally, as in
lesion patients. Choices are plentiful (Table 1). However,
the intended presence or absence of conscious experience
always has to be probed behaviorally, and that is where
trouble begins.

This is best illustrated with a classic example.
Split-brain patients (Table 1) can always report objects
presented in the right half field of vision. But when objects
are presented to the left, the patients say not to see them,
simply because these are processed by the isolated right
hemisphere, which has no capacity for language and
speech. However, many patients can draw these unseen
objects, select them from a row of other objects, match them
to words, or perform other (simple) cognitive operations, as
long as the behavior is executed by the left hand, which is
connected to the right hemisphere [4,5].

Here is the crucial question: Are these patients seeing
the objects in the left half field? They say not, and they
know best, don’t they? Consequently, we might conclude

that the right hemisphere is not part of the NCC for visual
experience. But can you draw something without seeing it?
And isn’t selection an expression of recognition and atten-
tion? Isn’t it unlikely that the right hemisphere cannot
sustain conscious experience, simply because it cannot
‘talk’? This would argue for not excluding the right hemi-
sphere from the NCC. Note that nothing intrinsic to the
behavioral experiments provides arguments for or against
either conclusion. It all depends on preconceived notions
about the role of language in consciousness, about which
much has been written but little concluded.

The example highlights two notorious difficulties in
gauging conscious experience from the third- (or even
first-) person perspective. The first is that some choice
has to be made as to what behavioral measures ‘count’
as evidence for the subject having conscious experience
(e.g. drawing versus talk) (Figure 1). The second is that in
such heterophenomenological observations conscious
experience is easily conflated with cognitive functions that
are necessary for the report (in this case language).

This problem has grave consequences for the search for
the NCC.Many similar examples exist, in which various, if
not all, parts of the brain have been included or excluded
from the NCC, entirely depending on the measure of
conscious experience, or the notion of consciousness that
is startedwith [6,7] (Table 1). This not only poses a problem
for finding the ‘true’ NCC; more serious is that, in this way,
neuroscience will hardly fulfill its promise to get rid of the
‘tedium of philosophers perpetually disagreeing with each
other’ [8].

To find a way out, I think we have to go beyond finding
‘neural correlates of ’, and let the arguments from neu-
roscience have a true say in the matter. To illustrate this,
I first identify the problems of treating visual experience as
anentirelymental or psychological concept. I thenshowhow
a more coherent scientific definition of conscious visual
experience emerges, when both behavioral and neural find-
ings, combined with theoretical concepts, are put on an
equal footing. Thiswill, however, entail a view on conscious-
ness that is moving away from our traditional or introspec-
tive notions. But this is the only way towards progress.
From neural activation to visual experience
A basic assumption of consciousness research is that when
a subject is presented with a visual stimulus it is either
seen or not seen. What happens in the brain when a
stimulus is shown, and can we establish when conscious
experience emerges from the neural activity it causes?

Manipulation of attention instead of

aIn blindsight, resulting from a lesion to V1, subjects can point at visual stimuli, or guess their shape, color or motion direction. However, subjects verbally deny any conscious

experience, nor can they detect the stimuli (i.e. discriminate presence or absence). Detection and talk carry more weight for the presence of conscious experience than

localization or guessing (Figure 1), and therefore blindsight is considered the classical example of visually guided behavior in the absence of conscious experience, even in

monkeys [37].

Why should we ‘trust’ these patients, when they say they have no visual experience, even though part of their behavior suggests otherwise? One reason is that the unseen

stimuli never spontaneously induce behavior, even after extensive training (although this does happen in monkeys); blindsight capacities only become evident in forced

laboratory settings. A second important argument is that no manipulation is capable of restoring, in the lesioned field, the normal vision that the same blindsight patient

reports to experience in the intact visual field. The information is and remains completely inaccessible.

This is radically different in other conditions or manipulations. For example, when attention is focused on a particular stream of information, this will often result in other

events going unnoticed, or being forgotten, as is observed in phenomena such as inattentional blindness [17], change blindness [19] or the attentional blink [55]. However, in

those cases, important events, such as hearing one’s name, might capture attention regardless. In other words, the unattended information is not inaccessible, it is just not

currently accessed [7]. Whether there is conscious experience in such cases is therefore an open question [7,13]. It could be that experience is present, yet cannot be reported

because of the absence of attention.

The table provides a list of manipulations and neuropsychological conditions, and conclusions that have been drawn with respect to the nature or locus of the NCC. A division

is made between manipulations where it is arguable whether conscious experience is manipulated instead of some other cognitive function (b) and cases where such

arguments would not hold (a). References are not meant to be exhaustive but only give hints for further search on the topic.

Figure 1. How to measure conscious experience? How can we tell whether a visual

stimulus is consciously perceived? Countless behavioral measures are possible,

some of which seem more reliable than others. I compiled a list by asking a group

of cognitive psychologists to rank measurements in order of the ‘weight’ these

carry as evidence for the subject having a conscious experience. Why do some

measures end up higher than others? To a large extent, this reflects ideas about the

nature of consciousness that have accumulated over years of psychological

research and philosophical debate. The problem lies not in the extreme ends of the

scale. But where should we draw the line between behavioral measures signaling

conscious versus unconscious processing? In searching for the NCC, behavioral

measures that in one study are taken as evidence of conscious experience are

taken as measures of unconscious processing in others. Consider the localization

and handling of objects. In blindsight and visual agnosia, these are taken as

reflecting unconscious processing of objects that cannot be consciously detected

or recognized [37,40]. In neglect and extinction [49], however, the failure of

patients to look at contralateral objects and manipulate them is taken to imply that

these objects are not reaching consciousness. Consequently, opposite conclusions

have been drawn from these categories of patients with respect to the locus of the

NCC (Table 1).

Figure 2. Feedforward sweep and recurrent processing. (a) The ‘feedforward

sweep’, the rapid transfer of visual information through the visual cortex and

towards motor areas producing a (potential) response. Within several milliseconds

each area extracts information about shape, color, motion, position, objects and

faces (see icons). Processing by the feedforward sweep is not, however,

accompanied by conscious experience of the visual input. (b) Recurrent

processing enables the exchange of information between higher and lower

areas, and within areas, by means of horizontal and feedback connections. Is

recurrent processing between visual areas sufficient for a conscious visual

percept? (c) Reportable conscious experience is present when the visual

recurrent core extends towards areas in executive space, such as the

frontoparietal network (Fr-Par), or language areas [9,10].

Opinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.11 497
enables a rapid extraction of complex and meaningful
features from the visual scene, and lays down potential
motor responses to act on the incoming information [9]
(Figure 2a).

Are we conscious of the features extracted by the
feedforward sweep? Do we see a face when a face-selective
neuron becomes active? It seems not. Many studies, in both
humans and monkeys, indicate that no matter what area
of the brain is reached by the feedforward sweep, this in
itself is not producing (reportable) conscious experience.
What seems necessary for conscious experience is that
neurons in visual areas engage in so-called recurrent (or
re-entrant or resonant) processing [9–11] (Figure 2b,c),
where high- and low-level areas interact. This would
enable the widespread exchange of information between
areas processing different attributes of the visual scene,
and thus support perceptual grouping [12]. In addition,
when recurrent interactions span the entire sensorimotor
hierarchy, or involve the frontoparietal areas, potential
motor responses could modify the visual responses, which
would form the neural equivalent of task set, attention,
etc. [7,10].
www.sciencedirect.com
That recurrent processing (RP) is necessary for
conscious experience [9,10] is a view that is now being
increasingly embraced [7,13,14], although challenging, but
entirely empirical, questions remain (Box 1). These are not,
however, the topic of discussion here.



Figure 3. Recurrent processing during inattentional blindness. Results from a

modified version of the experiment performed by Scholte et al. [16]. Subjects were

instructed to focus attention on a foveally presented stream of black and white

letters, and report the occurrence of white vowels. All letters were presented in

textured backgrounds, but at some occasions, additional square figures were

present in the surround of the fixation spot (as shown in the upper panel).

Afterwards, 50% of subject reported not to have seen these square figures, that is

they suffered from inattentional blindness or amnesia. Regardless, brain signals

recorded with EEG (middle), MEG [16] and fMRI (lower) revealed that the unseen

textured figures evoked recurrent interactions between several visual areas.

Box 1. Outstanding questions

� What is the crucial aspect of recurrent processing that is necessary
for conscious experience? Recurrent interactions invariably go

along with prolonged activation of high-level neurons, and it has

been shown, for example, that the duration of activation of face-

selective cells correlates strongly with visibility of masked faces

[36]. Can conscious experience be sustained on the basis of such

high-level activations alone, even in the absence of recurrency?

This could be answered by interrupting feedback signals to V1 (for

example with transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS), while at

the same time recording from face-selective inferior temporal (IT)

cells.

� Why would recurrent processing give rise to conscious experi-
ence? This so-called ‘hard problem’ [1] is difficult to answer at this

point. However, looking at the neural and molecular mechanisms

that sustain recurrent processing, such as the activation of NMDA-

type receptors [29,34], combined with theoretical notions about

the importance of recurrent processing [32] might open up venues

towards a deeper understanding of consciousness.

� If indeed there is conscious experience (in the neural sense) in
cases such as inattentional blindness, change blindness or

attentional blink, and possibly even in neuropsychological condi-

tions such as extinction or split brain, what is the nature of such

experiences? For example, does it allow subjects to learn from

these experiences? Would this support controversial issues such

as speed-reading, eidetic memory or recall under hypnosis?

498 Opinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.11
An impossible question?
Much more challenging is another question: is recurrency
in itself sufficient for conscious experience? Do we see a
face as soon as face-selective and lower-level cells engage in
recurrent interactions (Figure 2b)? At first sight, this
seems easy to answer. Any instance of RP in the absence
of reportable awareness would falsify the idea. Super et al.
[15] showed that recurrent interactions, recorded in V1 of
the awake monkey, are necessary for the animal reporting
the presence of texture defined figures. However,
raising the decision criterion of the monkey, simply by
increasing the number of catch trials, dissociates RP from
the behavioral response. Then, recurrent signals are also
present when the monkey fails to report a figure percept.
Another study (Figure 3) showed the presence of RP sig-
nals, while human subjects were in a state of inattentional
blindness (IB) towards the objects inducing these signals.
During IB, RP remained localized to visual areas. Objects
were only reported when the signals showed more wide-
spread interactions, possibly involving the frontoparietal
network [16].

Does this falsify the thesis that RP is sufficient for
conscious experience? Note the similarity with the split-
brain conundrum outlined above. It could be argued that
the only reasonwhy themonkey fails to report its conscious
experience is that we have raised the number of catch
trials, and hence themonkey’s decision criterion. Only if we
equate conscious experience to the outcome of his decision
process (or to the eye movement signaling that outcome)
can we fully ‘trust’ its report.

Similarly, does IB really show the absence of conscious
experience? Simply put, subjects just do not remember
stimuli presented outside their focus of attention [17].
Storage in episodic or working memory is taken as the
measure of conscious experience. Unless consciousness
and episodicmemory are taken as the same thing, it cannot
www.sciencedirect.com
be excluded that the subject was conscious of the stimulus
at the moment of its presentation, yet simply forgot about
it [18]. This might sound strange, but experiments on the
related phenomenon of change blindness [19] show that
unattended objects are represented in the mind in a fleet-
ing, yet reportable, representation that disappears as soon
as a new scene is presented or the eyes move to a new
location [20].

So again, we find ourselves in a labyrinth of arguments.
We could take the subject’s report at face value and
conclude that RP is insufficient for conscious experience.
In such a view, cognitive functions involved in conscious
report (attention, working memory and language) are part
and parcel of consciousness, whereas other functions are
unconscious. But then why not simply study these
cognitive functions, and abandon studying consciousness



Opinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.11 499
and the NCC? Moreover, any sharp division between con-
scious and unconscious cognitive functions will again be
arguable, often resorting to taste rather than scientific
argument.

The alternative view would hold that conscious
experience is only done full justice when viewed as
independent from other cognitive functions. Evidence for
this idea is found in the many instances of attention [21],
object recognition [22], learning [23], semantic processing
[24] and even reasoning [25] without conscious reportabil-
ity of what was learned, recognized, etc. In that view, RP
could be seen as the NCC of visual experience, even when
not reported. But how to verify conscious experience with-
out any cognitive function interfering? This even applies to
introspective reports. You cannot knowwhether you have a
conscious experience without resorting to cognitive func-
tions such as attention, memory or inner speech. This
problem lies at the heart of the seemingly unsolvable
debate on the existence of ‘non-accessible’ or phenomenal
(P-) consciousness [26].

Recently, the problem was recognized in the context of a
global workspace theory of consciousness [7]. It was
proposed to let such states of localized RP, not involving
the frontoparietal networks associated with attention and
reportability, fall in a category between the fully uncon-
scious and the fully conscious, called the ‘preconscious’,
where visual information is ‘visible yet not seen’. This
hardly solves the issue of whether there is any phenom-
enally conscious aspect to such a state, and the authors
acknowledge that whether there is conscious experience in
such a state ‘does not seem to be. . .a scientifically addres-
sable question’ [7].

Taking the neuroscience argument seriously
This is where I diverge. The question seems not
addressable because we do not let all scientific arguments
have their way, and treat conscious experience as some-
thing that can only be observed behaviorally or introspec-
tively. We could find a solution, when we let neuroscience
go beyond ‘finding neural correlates of ’. Consciousness
should not only be inferred from behavioral measures,
to which neural measurements are subordinate. Both
measures should be on an equal footing.

There is no need to doubt the presence of conscious
experience when a subject reports a clearly visible event,
nor its absence in cases such as blindsight or deeply
masked stimuli (Table 1a). In those cases, arguments
about the conflation of conscious experience with other
cognitive functions do not hold up. It is the middle ground
where additional, neural arguments become of value
(Table 1b). Let’s see what such arguments would bring
in answering the seemingly unanswerable: Is there con-
scious experience when RP is limited to visual areas, as
seems to be the case in inattentional or change blindness,
attentional blink, and possibly in conditions such as extinc-
tion and split brain?

A starting point would be the observation that when RP
encompasses visual as well as frontoparietal areas, a
reportable conscious experience ensues [7,10]. This begs
the obvious question as to what the essential neural
ingredient of this state is for the generation of conscious
www.sciencedirect.com
experience. Is it the involvement of the frontoparietal net-
work, as global workspace theory suggests, or is it the
recurrency? A neural argument against the former would
be that activation of cortical neurons per se, even activation
of frontoparietal neurons, is insufficient for conscious
experience, as is shown by various masking experiments
[14,27–29]. Thiswould promote the recurrency as being the
most important ingredient.

Another neural argument would come from considering
that RP is fundamentally different from feedforward
processing. RP creates a condition that satisfies the Hebb
rule, where the pre- and postsynaptic neurons are active
simultaneously. This will trigger the activation of synaptic
plasticity processes, which are the neural basis of learning
and memory [30]. In other words, stimuli that evoke RP
change your brain, while stimuli that evoke only feedfor-
ward activation have no lasting impact. It would be diffi-
cult to see why the involvement of the frontoparietal
network would make such a difference (after all, it is all
neurons firing action potentials, whether they are in the
back or front of the head). Cases of learning during inat-
tention provide evidence for the point [23].

Theoretical arguments further stress the importance
of recurrency. Tononi argues that consciousness is the
capacity of a system to integrate information [31,32]. This
capacity depends crucially on the system’s propensity to
form a ‘dynamic core’, or complex, characterized by the
strong mutual interactions among its elements, as well as
by its complexity, that is the large number of possible
states it can achieve. Because of its connectivity, the
corticothalamic network has the capacity to form dynamic
cores of high complexity, whereas other brain structures,
such as the cerebellum or basal ganglia, do not [32]. There-
fore, also in this account, recurrent interactions between
cortical neurons are the crucial feature of consciousness,
not which cortical regions sustain these interactions, which
is only relevant for the type of conscious experience that
results. Importantly, the proposal allows for multiple com-
plexes to exist at the same time [32]. In the IB experiment
(Figure 3), one complex could therefore represent the
attended stream of letters, while another would represent
the not-reported objects in the background. By definition,
both would be conscious representations.

According to such empirical and theoretical arguments,
RP is the key neural ingredient of consciousness. We could
even define consciousness as recurrent processing [10,33].
This could shed an entirely different light on the matter of
whether there is conscious phenomenal experience in
states of inattention, split brain or extinction. The matter
would now become a scientific debate, where evidence from
behavioral observations is weighed against the evidence
from neural measurements. If recurrent interactions of
sufficient strength are demonstrated, it can be argued that
the ‘inattentional’, ‘preconscious’ or ‘not reported’ still have
the key neural signatures of what would otherwise be
called conscious processing.

What do we lose, what do we gain. . .
Letting arguments from neuroscience override our
intuitive and introspective notion of consciousness seems
strange. After all, consciousness is almost synonymous to



500 Opinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.11
private access and personal feeling. So what is the benefit
of adopting a more neural stance on consciousness? At first
sight, we seem to lose explanatory power. There would be
instances of (neurally defined) conscious processing that
are not evident from behavioral measures or introspection
(Figure 3). It is not unusual in science, however, to move
away from intuitive notions. We have grown accustomed to
the fact that, despite appearances, dolphins should be
called mammals and sodium a metal. There are solid
scientific arguments to do so. Are there such arguments
in the case of RP and consciousness?

As noted above, RP is crucial for the induction of
synaptic plasticity. A first advantage of adopting a neural
definition of the conscious–unconscious dichotomy would
therefore be that we have a much more fundamental
understanding of what consciousness is or does: we need
consciousness to learn. This insight might also open up
ways towards an understanding of consciousness at the
cellular or molecular level, as synaptic plasticity is asso-
ciated with specific synapses and receptor types [30,34].
Although the ‘hard problem’ [1] is not solved by this in
itself, it holds better promises of doing so than traditional
NCC approaches.

A second advantage is that we would be able to
dissociate consciousness from other cognitive functions,
suchas attention,workingmemory and reportability,which
is a prerequisite for using the term at all. Elsewhere [10,33],
I have shown how, from the neural perspective, attention
and consciousness can be orthogonally defined as entirely
separate neural processes. When other cognitive functions
are neurally defined as well, we do not lose explanatory
power at all by adopting the neural stance. It can be easily
understoodwhy there is no reportability of conscious experi-
ence in the case of IB, split brain, neglect and other condi-
tions; in all these cases there are other cognitive functions
thanconsciousness (neurally defined) that aremanipulated,
which is causing the failure of reportability.

Third, the neural dichotomy between ‘recurrent =
conscious’ and ‘feedforward = unconscious’ yields testable
predictions for behavioral experiments. If indeed all recur-
rent processes share the feature of phenomenality and the
inclination to induce synaptic plasticity, it can be predicted
that learning will follow the phenomenal aspects of stimuli
(e.g. color), rather than their physical features (e.g. wave-
length), even when what is learned is not reportable.

Finally, an obvious advantage would be that we can
measure the presence or absence of consciousness without
resorting to behavioral measures, enabling us to settle
long-standing debates about the presence or absence of
consciousness in neural disease, locked-in syndrome, coma,
anesthesia, or animals. In fact, in these cases, neural
measures are our only resort.

. . . by moving our notion of mind towards that of brain?
I have tried to point out that, by adopting a partly neural
stance on consciousness, seemingly unsolvable issues in
consciousness research can be solved. I do not claim that
the neural definition of consciousness that I propose [10,33]
is ultimately correct. It is the approach that I advocate.
Alternative neural definitions might be proposed [7,35].
Our task should be to evaluate each of these on its scientific
www.sciencedirect.com
merits and capability to deal with all the phenomena
concerning consciousness and cognition. We should be
prepared, however, to abandon our traditional ideas about
what consciousness is, and let the neuroscience argument
have its way. Otherwise, it is useless to do any neu-
roscience on the topic at all.
