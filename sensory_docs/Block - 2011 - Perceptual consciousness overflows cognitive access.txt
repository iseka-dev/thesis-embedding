Perceptual consciousness overflows
cognitive access
Ned Block

Department of Philosophy, New York University, 5 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003, USA

One of the most important issues concerning the foun-
dations of conscious perception centers on the question
of whether perceptual consciousness is rich or sparse.
The overflow argument uses a form of ‘iconic memory’
to argue that perceptual consciousness is richer (i.e., has
a higher capacity) than cognitive access: when observ-
ing a complex scene we are conscious of more than we
can report or think about. Recently, the overflow argu-
ment has been challenged both empirically and concep-
tually. This paper reviews the controversy, arguing that
proponents of sparse perception are committed to the
postulation of (i) a peculiar kind of generic conscious
representation that has no independent rationale and
(ii) an unmotivated form of unconscious representation
that in some cases conflicts with what we know about
unconscious representation.

The current status of the overflow controversy
The overflow argument appeals to visual iconic memory
(see Glossary) to argue that a conscious perceptual system
that has ‘rich’ contents ‘overflows’ – that is, has a higher
capacity than – the ‘sparse’ system that cognitively
accesses perception [1–6]. A key experimental paradigm
that has provided support for the overflow argument was
introduced in 1960 by George Sperling. Sperling [7] showed
subjects an array of letters (for example, 3 rows of 4 letters
as in Figure 1a) for a brief period. Although subjects
thought they could see all or almost all of the letters, they
could report only 3-4 of them from the whole matrix.
However, they could also report 3-4 items from any row
that was cued after stimulus offset, suggesting that sub-
jects did have a persisting image of almost all the letters.
According to the overflow argument, all or almost all of the
12 items are consciously represented, perhaps fragmen-
tarily but well enough to distinguish among the 26 letters
of the alphabet. However, only 3-4 of these items can be
cognitively accessed, indicating a larger capacity in con-
scious phenomenology than in cognitive access. Important-
ly, the overflow argument does not claim that any of the
items in the array are cognitively inaccessible, but rather
that necessarily most are unaccessed. For comparison,
consider the following: not everyone can win the lottery;
however, this does not show that for any particular contes-
tant the lottery is unwinnable. In other words, to say that
necessarily most items in the array are not accessed is not
to say that any are inaccessible.

Why does the argument for overflow appeal to memory
rather than perception? It is not surprising that the capac-
ity of the retina is greater than that of working memory. By
relying on this form of memory, we isolate consciousness
from the immediate feed of the world and the retina. The
neural locus of the high memory capacity demonstrated in
the Sperling phenomenon is in brain areas that are candi-
dates for the neural basis of conscious perception rather
than in the retina or early vision [2,8–10], and so the
Sperling phenomenon may reveal the capacity of conscious
phenomenology.

Many theorists have taken change ‘blindness’ (illustrat-
ed in Figure 1b) to show that the overflow argument is
wrong. Unattended features of two pictures can differ
without the perceivers noticing the difference, despite
what seems to be clear perception of both pictures. Accord-
ing to the ‘inattentional blindness’ interpretation of this
phenomenon [11–15], one does not notice the difference
because one simply does not consciously see the specific
aspect of the scene that constitutes the difference (for
instance, the item that is present in one picture, absent
in the other). According to the ‘inattentional inaccessibility’
interpretation [1,4–6,16–19], one normally consciously
sees the item that constitutes the difference but fails to
categorize or conceptualize it in a way that allows for
comparison. Advocates of ‘inattentional inaccessibility’
think the term ‘change blindness’ is a misnomer.

Glossary

Access consciousness: a representation is access-conscious if it is made

available to cognitive processing.

Change blindness: a misnomer for the phenomenon where people fail to

identify changes in stimuli that are easy to notice if one attends to and

conceptualizes the items that change.

Fragile visual short-term memory: a type of visual short-term memory, which

consists in a persisting visual representation that is intermediate in capacity

between retinally-based visual iconic memory and visual working memory and

can last 4-5 seconds.

Introspective judgment: first-person judgment made about one’s experience.

The overflow argument: an argument to the effect that the capacity of

phenomenal consciousness exceeds that of cognitive access.

Phenomenal consciousness: what it is like for a subject to have an experience.

Visual iconic memory: a type of visual short-term memory in which visual

representations persist after the stimulus has disappeared. Retinal persistence

fuels what might be termed ‘pure’ visual iconic memory, lasting a few hundred

milliseconds, whereas the weaker fragile visual short-term memory is based on

persisting cortical activation.

Visual short-term memory: a term that is ambiguous between visual iconic

memory, fragile visual short-term memory and visual working memory

Visual working memory: a form of short-term memory which can persist much

longer and has a smaller capacity than any form of iconic memory and

probably requires categorization. This form of memory is often regarded as the

leading edge of long-term memory and is largely shared with other perceptual

modalities (see Box 1).

One issue in the debate has been the status of an often
reported introspective judgment on the part of subjects in
experiments with brief presentations [7,20–23] that one
consciously sees more than one can cognitively grasp. This
introspective judgment is regarded by some advocates of
‘inattentional blindness’ as the product of a cognitive illu-
sion – the so-called ‘refrigerator light illusion’ [13,24–26] –
according to which, one can see items whenever one attends
to their location, thereupon assuming that they were al-
ready consciously represented [13,24]. Although there is no
direct evidence for the refrigerator light illusion, it has been
claimed recently that there is direct evidence that the
introspection of richness is the product of one of a family
of perceptual rather than cognitive illusions [27–34].

In short, the overflow argument has come under pres-
sure both empirically [27–29,33,35], and conceptually [27–
34] largely on the basis of ‘change blindness’. At the same
time, support for overflow has come from experiments
employing other paradigms [8,9,36–42]. This article
assesses the argument for overflow in light of these recent
contributions, arguing that rich perceptual contents com-
port better with the evidence than sparse contents.

Generic consciousness combined with unconscious
iconic memory
Since experimental subjects can perform the Sperling task
successfully, information sufficient to determine 3-4 letters
in each of 3 rows – that is, approximately 10.5 letters –
must be instantiated in the brain. The fact that subjects in
such experiments often observe that ‘they saw more than
they remembered’ ([23], p. 39) motivates the premise of the

overflow argument that the information is conscious. How-
ever, many critics starting with Kouider and Dehaene have
claimed that this information is not conscious until
attended and accessed [25,28–32,43,44]. As Cohen and
Dennett put it: ‘[p]articipants can identify cued items
because their identities are stored unconsciously until
the cue brings them to the focus of attention’ ([29] p.
359). Advocates of this view do not regard subjects’ reports
of a persisting conscious icon as wholly illusory; rather
what some of them claim is that the conscious icon contains
generic, non-specific, abstract or gist-like letter represen-
tations that are neutral between the shape of one letter and
another [28–30,33,34,44–50]. They postulate what I will
call the ‘generic illusion’, whereby subjects are said to
confuse a generic representation of letter-likeness (parts
of which can be made more specific via attention) with
specific letter-shape representations that are already spec-
ified in consciousness. Cohen and Dennett emphasized gist
and ensemble representations as well as generic represen-
tations [29]. One illustration of gist/ensemble representa-
tions was provided by Alvarez [51], who showed that when
subjects track 4 moving disks they also are aware of the
‘center of mass’ of 4 distractor disks. For simplicity, I will
lump gist-like and generic perception together under the
heading of generic representation. The view that what is
conscious before the cue is generic letter representations is
depicted in Figure 2a.

A very different idea of what is in consciousness prior to
the cue [28,29,33,34] is a scattering of some conscious
features or fragments [27,28]. Attentional processes are
supposed to combine the unconscious specific information
from the cued row with conscious features or fragments to
form conscious representations of specific letters in that
one row. Kouider and colleagues have postulated a ‘frag-
ment illusion’ to explain subjects’ impression that they see
a grid of specific letters when according to Kouider what
they see is sparse fragments. What is common to both the
supposed generic illusion and the fragment illusion is
depicted in the lower left quadrant of Figure 2a, which
indicates that the specific information on the basis of which
subjects do the task is unconscious, only becoming con-
scious when amplified by the cue.

The fragment illusion vs. the generic illusion
Subjects in a Sperling-like experiment sometimes mistake
a pseudo-letter, specifically a rotated or flipped letter, in a
non-cued row for a real letter [27,28]. (Note that there are
no illusions involving cued rows.) The procedure of this
experiment is diagrammed in Figure 3.

The devil is in the details: first, the contrast of the
displays in this experiment was reduced. Second, the dis-
plays were masked. (The authors say: ‘[i]mportantly, we
also added a backward mask to the stimulus array, to
eliminate possible retinal persistence of the visual infor-
mation, which is not supposed to constitute phenomenal
consciousness, but rather to input the phenomenal level
(Block, 2007)’ [27]). The effect of this manipulation was to
significantly diminish the icon. How diminished? In stan-
dard Sperling paradigms (in which there is no mask),
subjects recall approximately 3.5 items correctly from
any cued row. That adds up to a total capacity of 10.5

when the change is pointed out it often seems incredible that one could have

missed it. This can happen even when the pictures are arrayed side by side. Do the

pictures in the figure differ or not? The answer appears at the end of this caption,

out of 12 items in the array, the ‘partial report advantage’,
which shows that iconic memory has a higher capacity than
working memory (Box 1). In the experiment just described,
the average recall is only 1.47 out of 4 items in each row,
that is, 4.41 out of 12 (and only 3.9 out of 12 in cases where
a pseudo-letter is present), not much above the capacity of
working memory. It is usually said that the icon in the
Sperling experiment has vanished by 500 ms because the
average for any given row decreases to 1.5 letters [38] so by
that criterion there is no icon in this experiment. The
experiment by Kouider and colleagues [27] is taken to
show that iconic memory in the Sperling experiment is
fragmentary. However, the fragmentariness demonstrated
may be due to the icon being diminished by low contrast

stimuli and a mask. The experimenters were right to want
to disrupt retinal persistence. However, there is a way to do
that without disrupting iconic memory, by using an iso-
luminant stimulus of the type used by Sligte et al. [8] (see
Figure 4b), since it is invisible to (color blind) rods, which
are the main source of retinal persistence.

Furthermore, the illusion effect is small. The authors
calculate the rate of errors due to illusion (always in the
uncued rows) to be in the vicinity of 10%-15%, not a
surprising level of error from the perspective of a ‘rich’
view of perception that also allows that the shape repre-
sentations contain features and feature fragments, so long
as the fragments are specific enough to do the task with the
observed degree of success [52]. This experiment makes it
plausible that a robust icon of the sort in a normal Sperling-
type experiment, even if fragmentary, does involve enough
phenomenally conscious shape information to distinguish
3-4 out of the 26 possible letters in all three rows.

The putative ‘fragment illusion’ concerns the upper
right quadrant of Figure 2a which depicts the conscious
icon after the cue. (Recall that the ‘free subjective report’
procedure from Figure 3 in which subjects are supposed to
click the mouse over items that were in the array occurs
well after the cue.) The experiment is supposed to show

experiments. (a) The generic illusion approach to the Sperling experiment. The

upper left quadrant represents what is conscious in iconic memory prior to the cue

– the ‘ ’ symbols are meant to indicate a phenomenal representation of a ‘gist-like’

or ‘generic letter’ that does not contain information sufficiently specific to decide

among letters. The Sperling array is supposed to appear to the subject prior to the

cue as an array of letters that don’t look like any specific letter. The lower left

quadrant indicates that the specific information necessary to do the Sperling task is

in an unconscious representation. The green ellipse represents attentional capture

and amplification that is supposed to move the unconscious specific information

necessary to do the task into consciousness. The upper right quadrant represents

the contents of consciousness after the cue, in which the cued row is conscious.

The upshot is that the information on the basis of which a subject does the

Sperling task is in unconscious iconic memory with consciousness representing

only a geometric array of generic gists plus fragmentary sparse features before the

cue. (b) The generic illusion approach to the Amsterdam group experiments.

Question-marks in the conscious representation indicate generic unoriented

rectangles. The way the initial Amsterdam array is supposed to appear to the

subject is as an array of non-square rectangles with no specified orientation. As

before, the green ellipse represents attentional capture and amplification that is

supposed to move the unconscious specific information necessary to do the task

into consciousness.

Figure 3. Kouider et al.’s modified Sperling paradigm [27,28]. An array of normal

letters and other symbols (lower left) is presented for 500 ms and then ‘masked’,

that is, followed by a pattern that makes them harder to see. (Masking was not

used in the original Sperling experiment.) The array might have a rotated or

flipped letter, for example the ‘R’ in the last row, or a ‘wingding’, such as the non-

letters in the top panel above. An aural cue is presented, the pitch of which tells the

subject to focus on a specific row. The subject then reports as many letters in the

cued row as possible, as indicated in the second from top panel. In some trials,

there is a ‘free subjective report’ procedure, during which the subject moves a

cursor over a set of symbols, clicking when one of the symbols is thought to have

occurred in the original array (top panel). Wingdings were recognized reliably

whether they were in the cued or uncued rows, but rotated or flipped letters were

only recognized reliably if they occurred in the cued rows – that is, sometimes

subjects saw, for example, a rotated ‘R’ in an uncued row but in the free subjective

report (top panel) reported a real ‘R’. Reproduced, with permission, from [28].

that the conscious generic representations plus conscious
fragments from the uncued rows cannot support letter
identification, on the assumption that letter identifications
are done on the basis of conscious representations. This
reasoning is conceptually flawed, however, since the over-
flow argument is concerned with whatever it is in the
conscious pre-cue icon (i.e., the upper left, not upper right
quadrant) that allows subjects to do the task. The overflow
argument takes no stand on whether or not the cue erases
that conscious icon – and the cue has historically been
pointed out as a source of decay of the icon. However, the
fact that enough of the conscious representation does
persist after the cue as indicated by the low (10%-15%)
error rate – even with a very diminished icon – suggests
that before the cue (Figure 2a, upper left quadrant) there
was at least as much specific conscious information from all
the rows as after the cue, since the cue cannot be expected
to magnify conscious information in the uncued rows.
Thus, contrary to what the authors argue, this result is
consistent with the overflow argument and the hypothesis
of rich phenomenology.

There is one factor in common to the supposed
‘generic illusion’ – the idea that the subjects’ consciousness

represents a grid of letters without any specific conscious
information about what letters they are – and the supposed
‘fragment illusion’ – the idea that what is in the subjects’
consciousness is fragments of letters or clusters of letter
features. That common factor is the appeal to unconscious
iconic memory that is specific enough to provide the infor-
mation to do the task. However, there is no independent
evidence for highly detailed unconscious iconic memory,
and it goes counter to what subjects report about their own
experience. As Baars notes, even after finding that they can
report only 3 or 4 of the items, ‘subjects – and experimen-
ters serving as subjects – continue to insist that they are
momentarily conscious of all the elements in the array’
([53], p. 15). Between the two illusions, the fragment
illusion is somewhat more plausible, since it is difficult
to understand what it would mean for subjects’ conscious-
ness prior to the cue to consist of conscious representations
of a grid of instances of letterness without any specific
shape representations. Critics of overflow [29,30,33] ap-
peal to cases such as peripheral vision as an example of
generic representation. However, even if it is true that we
can see movement without shape in the periphery, this
would probably stem from specialized motion-detection

Box 1. Working memory

In the Sperling experiment, subjects recall about 3-4 items from an

array of 12-16, and also from any cued row. The same number

(though decreased slightly for infants) shows up in a variety of

experiments that track memory of ongoing events [63,64]. For

example, if a monkey sees an experimenter ostentatiously place a

small number of pieces of apple in one bucket, one at a time, and a

small number in another bucket, again one at a time, when the

experimenter withdraws, the monkey reliably goes to the bucket with

more pieces if the numbers of pieces in both buckets are 4 or fewer

[65,66]. However, if the number of pieces in one of the buckets

exceeds 4, the monkey’s choices are at chance level: for instance, in

the case of 3 vs. 4, monkeys reliably pick 4, but in the case of 3 vs. 8,

they choose randomly. One might have guessed that more than 4

would be represented as ‘a lot’, but no; their working memory storage

appears limited to 4 ‘chunks’ [65,66]. Similar results were obtained

with infants using this paradigm [67] and a completely different

paradigm [68] and even for bees [69]. Using yet a different paradigm,

a limit of 4 was also shown with multimodal stimuli–4 visual items or

3 visual items plus one spoken digit [70].

One of the basic controversies concerning working memory [71] is

the question of whether the limit that shows up in so many paradigms

is a basic feature of working memory [64,71–74] or a by-product of a

shared pool of resources [75,76] and its mode of distribution to

different representations. Alvarez and Cavanagh [77] showed (see

Figure I) that how many object-representations are held in working

memory and their resolution depends on their complexity, with a 4

item limit for colors but a 2 item limit for 3-D cubes [73,77],

disconfirming a simple ‘slot’ model [78,79]. The work reported in

Figure I suggests a limit between 4 and 5 for ideally simple items.

More recent work suggests a more complex version of a model that

combines something like slots with hierarchical structures represent-

ing objects and their properties [79,80]. The work discussed in the

main text concerning three forms of visual short-term memory

separately estimates variants of iconic memory and working memory.

There are strong complexity effects in these experiments, but the

capacity of fragile visual short-term memory discussed in the main

text is always substantially greater than working memory for any

given set of materials.

Extrapolating their data points suggests a limit of about 4.7 for theoretical stimuli with no information content. Both information load and number of objects limit visual

working memory. This figure comes from an adaptation of Alvarez & Cavanagh’s figure by S.J. Luck [71]. Reproduced, with permission, from [71].

circuits in cortical area MT/V5 and does not show that we
can consciously see generic letterness. Stazicker [30]
appeals to crowding as a case of conscious generic letter
representation. However, subjects’ reports of the experi-
ence of crowding do not sound anything like generic letter
representation. Pelli’s descriptions reflect a ‘mess’ of fea-
tures, what he describes as ‘excessive integration’, whereby
the visual system registers features clearly but does not
make a clear assignment of features to individual items
([54], p. 1136).

Putting together the doubtfulness of conscious generic
letterness with the evidence provided by Kouider et al. [27],
the best view would be one in which the conscious frag-
ments are sufficient to determine the differences among
the letters of the alphabet for 3-4 items in all three rows, a
total of about 10.5 specific shape representations in con-
sciousness. That would explain the results in accord with
what subjects say about their own experience while allow-
ing for a minor illusion effect, as found by Kouider et al.
[27]. And it would support rich phenomenology.

Theorizing about consciousness always depends in part
on introspective judgments, but the reasoning I just gave in
support of rich phenomenology makes use of aspects of
these judgments that are accepted by both sides in the
debate.

Three forms of visual short-term memory
A number of laboratories have shown that cues presented
up to 12 seconds after an array has disappeared can en-
hance memory for the array [4,39,55–57]. This technique
has been exploited most impressively by a group at the
University of Amsterdam that has amassed evidence for a
third form of memory, ‘fragile visual short-term memory’
(fragile VSTM) [8,9,36,37,60], in addition to iconic and
working memory (see Figure 4a for a depiction of the basic
experimental procedure employed by this group). Fragile
VSTM appears to have a capacity intermediate between
iconic and working memory: experiments along these lines
have shown capacities for fragile VSTM of nearly double
that of working memory using the paradigm of Figure 4a
and even higher for the materials of Figure 4b.

Using the paradigm of Figure 4a, with initial arrays and
cues as in 4b, subjects who receive the cue 10 msec after the
initial array vanishes get 30 of 32 orientations right for the
black-white display but only 20 right for the isoluminant
red-gray display [8]. Since the isoluminant display is in-
visible to rods (which fire much longer than cones [58] but
are color blind), it looks as if fragile VSTM may just be a
weakened form of iconic memory. However, if the cue is
presented 1 second or later after the first array, there is no
difference in informational capacity between subjects who
have seen the black-white display and those who have seen
the red-gray display, demonstrating that fragile VSTM has
no retinal component, unlike pure iconic memory. A second
finding is that a flash of light – presented just before the cue
– eliminates the difference between the black-white and
red-gray displays when presented at 10 msec but has no
effect when presented at 1 second or later. With cue delays
up to 4 seconds, capacities for fragile VSTM are still well
above the 4 items of working memory – 7 of 8 items at 1
second, 6 of 8 at 2.5 seconds and 5 of 8 at 4 seconds – while

working memory remains steady at 4 items. Capacities for
more complex stimuli are smaller [8,36], however, in a
third finding that supports a difference between pure iconic
memory and fragile VSTM, the proportionality between
iconic and fragile VSTM remains about the same.

Importantly for the argument I will make below, Land-
man et al. [56] showed that subjects could make reports
based on whether an item changed in either size or orien-
tation, as well as size and orientation separately, which

Box 2. High-capacity mental imagery

A completely different paradigm [41,42] has provided further

evidence in support of the overflow argument (Figure I). In these

experiments, subjects were able to maintain a 12 dot image for up to

4-5 seconds with accuracies of about 90% as shown by the subjects’

ability to superimpose the 12 dots on a 12-dot partial grid on the

screen. This finding argues against sparse-consciousness theories,

according to which one would expect much smaller capacities.

Figure I. Superimposing an imaged partial grid on a displayed partial grid.

Brockmole et al. [41] used a procedure in which a 5 by 5 grid of dots with one

missing dot is separated into two 12-dot partial grids. These partial grids, if

superimposed, form a 5 by 5 grid with a missing dot. One such partial grid is

presented on the screen briefly and subjects are encouraged to form an image

of it. After a delay of 1-5 seconds, the second partial grid is presented and stays

on the screen. The subjects’ task is to identify the missing dot, something they

can easily do if they can superimpose the imaged grid on the projected grid.

The subjects’ capacity for the imaged dots (percentage of dots remembered)

can be computed by the type of errors made. The figure graphs this capacity

measure against time. The subjects’ retention of the initial grid drops rapidly

immediately after the grid vanishes but after about 100 ms the percentage of

dots remembered rises, reaching an asymptote at around 90% of the dots

retained at a delay of about 1.5 seconds, a period that has been independently

calculated by Kosslyn [81] to be the time it takes to generate a mental image.

The dotted line in the figure represents the percentage of dots remembered

from the first grid. (The solid line represents accuracy for the dots that are

actually on the screen; of course the subjects very rarely say a dot in the display

in front of them is missing.) The subjects report that they are generating an

image and superimposing it on the partial grid on the screen, and their

performance confirms their introspective judgments. This experiment has

been replicated by Kosslyn [42] using memorized partial grids generated from

commands. Reproduced, with permission, from [41].

Figure 4. The Amsterdam group paradigms. (a) The basic Amsterdam paradigm [37]. An initial array is presented briefly after a fixation point (as depicted in the two

leftmost panels). In this version, the initial array has 8 oriented rectangles and is presented for 250 msec. This is followed by a delay, then at the end of the sequence of both

(i) and (ii) the probe array is presented, which is the same as the initial array, except one item may have changed orientation. At one or another point in this sequence a cue

is presented that indicates to the subject that the indicated rectangle on the initial array is to be compared with the corresponding rectangle in the probe array. The subject

makes a same/different judgment. The cue can come 10 ms after the memory array offset (not depicted in the figure), in which case it tests the capacity of iconic memory; or

it can come at some point in the middle, as in (i), usually between 1 and 4 seconds after the initial array offset, in which case it reflects the capacity of fragile visual short-

term memory; or it can come with the probe array, as in (ii), in which case it tests working memory. Reproduced, with permission, from [37]. (b) The prevention of retinal

persistence paradigm [8]. The array on the left is black/white whereas the array on the right is isoluminant red/gray. The array on the left excites rods in the retina but the

one on the right does not, since rods are color blind. Rods are mainly responsible for retinal persistence. The bottom item is the cue display used for these arrays instead of

the line in (a). Reproduced, with permission, from [8]. (c) High-resolution image paradigm [36]. The initial display consisted of 8 colored objects. As in the experiments

described earlier, cues could be presented (ii) just 10 ms after the offset of the memory display (measuring pure iconic memory), (iii) 1 second after the offset (measuring

fragile VSTM), or (iv) with the probe display (measuring working memory). Subjects were asked to report whether the indicated item had changed or not. In addition, on

change trials, subjects were presented with the item from the memory display that had changed together with 3 other distractors that had not been involved in the displays

(see rightmost set of panels in (i)). They were asked which of the items was the initial display item. In trials in which the subjects could not only detect the change but could

indicates that their representations included both dimen-
sions, suggesting an image-like representation.

I mentioned that earlier work (summarized in [2,10])
showed that iconic memory is not based in early vision, but,
in light of these findings, one sees that the so-called ‘iconic
memory’ that was the subject of those Sperling experi-
ments was an amalgam of two different kinds of memory: a
rod-based ‘pure iconic’ memory lasting at most a few
hundred msec and a much longer-lived fragile VSTM that
is based higher up in the visual system and lasts up to 4-
5 seconds. Indeed, Sligte et al. [9] found neuroimaging
evidence of long lasting spatiotopic representations that
correspond to fragile VSTM in visual area V4 but not in the
lower areas V1, V2 or V3.

What is most relevant to the overflow argument is not
that fragile VSTM differs from iconic memory but rather
that it differs from working memory. As I mentioned, the
capacities differ. Makovski and Jiang [38,57] have also
found capacities comparable to the Amsterdam group’s
fragile VSTM that are greater than working memory
though with a smaller advantage of fragile VSTM over
working memory than the Amsterdam group: 30% for
colors and 40% for odd shapes as compared with a mini-
mum of 80% higher from the Amsterdam group. As
Makovski et al. [38] point out, the difference is probably
due to the fact that they used 9 colors and 10 odd shapes
that are more confusable than the oriented lines used in
most of the Amsterdam group’s experiments. However, the
similarities in these findings are more important to my
case than the differences: both groups have found substan-
tial capacity differences between working memory and
fragile VSTM with cues presented 1 second or more after
the initial display.

These capacity differences are also compatible with a
view which assumes that fragile VSTM is just a weaker but
richer form of working memory, attention being required to
boost representations to a strength that would be mani-
fested in standard working memory paradigms of the type
mentioned in Box 1. A number of recent experiments,
however, disconfirm the weaker/richer hypothesis.

The Amsterdam group used colored drawings in an
experiment distinguishing between pure iconic memory,
fragile VSTM and working memory, as before (see
Figure 4c) [36]. All capacities were reduced significantly
compared to the experiments with oriented rectangles
described earlier. This experiment also involved a test of
whether subjects remembered the original cued object from
the memory array after the cue. In comparing memory for
that original item, Sligte et al. found a nearly four-fold
difference between fragile VSTM and working memory in
high resolution representations, which suggests that frag-
ile VSTM and working memory are at least partly based in
distinct systems.

Vandenbroucke et al. [37] used three methods for de-
creasing attention to tasks of the sort I have been describ-
ing. The upshot was that all three methods of decreasing
attention substantially decreased working memory scores,
but only slightly decreased fragile VSTM. This differential

effect of attention again suggests that fragile VSTM and
working memory are partly based in distinct systems.
Another experiment showed that a magnetic pulse deliv-
ered to right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – an area known
to play a primary role in working memory [59] – decreased
working memory but not fragile VSTM [60].

In sum, there is evidence for a form of conscious memory
that has a substantially higher capacity than working
memory but, unlike iconic memory, is not based in the
retina or early vision.

The generic illusion redux
Those anti-overflow theorists who have discussed the
Amsterdam findings explain them by proposing generic
representations of the initial array plus unconscious repre-
sentations that are specific enough to do the task with the
observed accuracy [29–32]. The cue is supposed to promote
attentional amplification of the cued unconscious specific
representation, which, when combined with the conscious
generic representation, results in a conscious specific re-
presentation of the cued item. This account is depicted in
Figure 2b. Phillips [31] supports this theory by noting that
the forced-choice procedure of the Amsterdam group (in
which the response required is to indicate whether or not
the cued rectangle changed orientation between the initial
and probe display) can reflect unconsciously driven gues-
sing, as it does in blindsight. However, there is an impor-
tant detail of one of the experiments described above that
suggests otherwise. Recall that in the experiment depicted
in 4c there was a four-fold difference between fragile VSTM
and working memory in representations in which the
subjects could choose the original cued object from 4 items,
suggesting conscious representations of the original object
playing a role. Could the choice of the original cued object
be unconscious too? In principle, it could; however, we will
not get anywhere in consciousness research by accepting
the less plausible account.

There has been one direct test of the power of uncon-
scious working memory (but see also [61]). Soto et al. [62]
showed subjects a display that could either contain nothing
or else a masked grid (a Gabor patch) tilted in one of six
orientations, and asked subjects to judge whether it was
tilted clockwise or counterclockwise relative to a highly
visible second grid presented 2 or 5 seconds later. (The two
grids always differed by 30o.) Subjects were then asked to
rate the initial display for visibility of the grid. Those
subjects who rated the initial display at the lowest level
of visibility (‘didn’t see anything’) could still compare it to
the subsequent grid at a level above chance (slightly above
55%), even at 5 seconds later. The initial grid may have
been seen with a mix of conscious and unconscious percep-
tion, as indicated by above chance sensitivity (d’ = .297) to
whether a grid was present or absent. (Subjects were more
likely to give the lowest visibility score (.557) when there
was no stimulus than when there was a stimulus (.441).)
This task would be easy, compared to the Amsterdam
tasks, if the initial grid was seen fully consciously, since
there is only one item and so no need for a cue. Thus the

also say what the original item was, the representation was classified as high resolution. Detecting either the change or knowing the item that changed – but not both – was

taken to indicate a low resolution representation. The number of high resolution representations in fragile VSTM was approximately 4 compared to slightly above 1 in

working memory. Reproduced, with permission, from [36].

only direct evidence of the power of unconscious working
memory suggests it is too weak to explain the memory of up
to 5 oriented rectangles for up to 4-5 seconds in the Amster-
dam paradigm.

One way in which the generic illusion account is more
plausible for the Amsterdam group experiments than for
the Sperling experiment is that the longer persistencies of
the images in the Amsterdam group experiments do allow
for the possibility that reports of reading the result off of
the image could be due to attention moving from one
rectangle to another, boosting them in turn from generic
to specific. Variation of attention could in principle be
tested by neuroimaging.

To sum up, the postulation of unconscious highly de-
tailed iconic memory is unmotivated as noted in the dis-
cussion of the Sperling experiment and the evidence
concerning unconscious perception suggests it is too weak
to account for its results. In addition, Sligte et al.’s [9]
evidence that persisting fragile VSTM is visible in V4 but
not V1, V2 or V3 argues against highly detailed uncon-
scious representations, since early visual areas would be
the most obvious candidates for their locations. Finally,
generic conscious representations of non-square rectangles
that do not specify between horizontal and vertical orien-
tations is difficult to accept. Although this issue is certainly
still open, it is reasonable to tentatively accept the overflow
interpretation and reject an interpretation of these experi-
ments that appeals to the generic illusion.

A further type of experimental evidence for overflow is
presented in Box 2.

Concluding remarks
There are two philosophical fallacies that may lead the
anti-overflow forces astray. First, many critics of the over-
flow argument seem to think that a vote for overflow is a
vote for inaccessible consciousness. For example, Cohen
and Dennett [29] group the two views together as ‘disso-
ciative’ theories that stand or fall together. However, as
pointed out earlier, the fact that necessarily most items are
not accessed does not entail inaccessibility of any items. A
second mistake is to suppose that unconscious images are
somehow the default view, something we have to be dis-
lodged from by powerful evidence. As Phillips puts it, ‘[m]y
claim is only this: for all that has been said, we have no
reason to deny that performance in Landman and Sligte‘s
change detection studies results simply from sub-personal,
non-conscious informational persistence’ ([31], p. 407). If
instead we adopt the methodology of asking which hypoth-
esis is better supported, I think we should prefer the
overflow hypothesis.
